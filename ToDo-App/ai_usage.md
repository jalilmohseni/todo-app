## ✅ Purpose of Using AI

AI was used as a **collaborative assistant** to:
- Accelerate development
- Validate logic and code structure
- Solve runtime bugs
- Learn best practices

---

## 📌 Tasks Where AI Provided Assistance

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Project Setup | Guidance on creating a React project using Vite |
| ✅ Component Structure | Helped design modular components: `TaskInput`, `TaskItem`, `TaskList`, `ThemeToggle` |
| ✅ State & Hooks | Custom `useLocalStorage` hook for persistence |
| ✅ Theme Toggle | Implemented light/dark mode with class handling and accessibility labels |
| ✅ Input Validation | Added task validation (empty/duplicate check) logic |
| ✅ Styling | Wrote responsive CSS for desktop and mobile views |
| ✅ Debugging | Solved JSON parsing error from malformed `localStorage` data |
| ✅ Final Review | Code cleanup, formatting, and file organization |
| ✅ Documentation | Generated `README.md` and this `ai_usage.md` file |

## 🧠 How AI Was Used

AI suggestions were used as:
- Reference examples, not copy-paste code
- Debugging explanations for specific errors
- A second set of eyes to review logic and structure
- A tutor for learning best practices in React + Vite

---

## 📝 Final Work

- All submitted code was reviewed, tested, and adjusted manually before finalizing.
- AI did not write the project from scratch but supported development iteratively.
